          <p>Relationships between graphic designers and their clients are so important. Too many times this relationship becomes unnecessarily stressed while discussing pricing for a project. A majority of the time, the client’s main thought is, “Why is design work so expensive?” There is rarely a client who is having a problem with how cheap a project is.</p>
          
          <p>I have tried to write this from both points of view—the designer and the client. I wanted to write this to help explain designers' processes and how we approach a new project, specifically the pricing aspect. Due to all the factors that go into pricing, this is could be a complicated subject, so I will try to keep it simple.</p>
          
          <h2 id="the-estimation-explanation">The Estimation Explanation</h2>
          
          <p>Estimates have the possibility to leave a bittersweet taste. A sweet taste because of the excitement of future changes and new products; a bitter taste because of how much those changes might end up costing. First and foremost, all price estimations should have an explanation attached to them. Whether it is in a letter or contract format, either one should be able to clearly explain all the factors that go into the price. The worst, in my opinion, is when the numbers are presented without any explanation. Clients, if you have a new project that seems to be priced little high, I strongly encourage you to get an explanation for the price from the designer if you have not gotten one. This gives the designers a chance to explain why certain things cost the amount they do. You never know, the explanation might change your mind and you could end up with a really great final product. Designers, please make sure you can explain why the cost is the way it is. I know that the price might not seem high to you, but if you can’t explain why it’s priced in a certain way, you probably shouldn’t charge that much.</p>
          
          <h2 id="the-factors">The Factors</h2>
          
          <p>Whether in contract or letter, the explanation might still be unclear. This could result from a bad explanation, an unfamiliarity with the graphic design process, or many other reasons. For me, there are five main factors that I take into account for pricing a project: designer experience and quality, project scope, turnaround time, miscellaneous factors, and most importantly the workload. Let me take a short minute to explain each of these:</p>
          
          <h3 id="designer-experience-and-quality">Designer Experience and Quality</h3>
          
          <p>Just like many jobs, employees get paid partly based on the amount of experience they have. This includes both educational and “real-world” experience. Many designers should have a good understanding of where they lie on the scale of experience, which means that most designers should be pretty trustworthy in this area. If you believe that the price is questionable based on the designer’s experience, feel free to ask them about it. Just remember that the price they quote might not be determined so much by their experience as it would be by another factor listed below.</p>
          
          <h3 id="project-scope">Project Scope</h3>
          
          <p>“Scope” is simply a fancy word that refers to all the details of a project. These details fluctuate depending on each project so it’s hard to explain what all goes into this area, but each party should have a clear understanding of all the details that are requested and need to be completed by the designer. The designer should be able to explain why some details make it more expensive.</p>
          
          <h3 id="turnaround-time">Turnaround Time</h3>
          
          <p>If a client hires a designer to complete a logo in one week, the price will obviously need to be higher than if the logo only needed to be completed within the year. This is similar to shipping of a product that is ordered online; shipping and handling always cost more depending on how fast the product needs to be delivered. This is due to the extra work that the shipping company has to complete in order to deliver it on-time.</p>
          
          <h3 id="miscellaneous-factors">Miscellaneous Factors</h3>
          
          <p>This is a very broad factor. It can include anything from availability of the designer to location of the client. If a designer is busy, he or she will need to charge more because of the extra time that they will be having to put into a project. Another example would be the time differences between the UK and the US. Some designers would charge more just because of the difficulty that location and time changes could present. Because of the broadness of this factor, feel free to discuss this with the designer in detail if needed.</p>
          
          <h3 id="the-designers-workload">The Designer's Workload</h3>
          
          <p>As mentioned above, the designer’s workload is one of the most important factors in determining the price of a project. Many times, the work for your project is in addition to other projects they are working on.</p>
          
          <h2 id="designer-process">Designer Process</h2>
          
          <p>Each designer has his or her own way of completing a project that they were hired to do. Across the board, the general outline of the creative process is similar to this: research, planning and concepts, digital creation and implementation. Each phase should be treated as equally important, but some phases require more hours.</p>
          
          <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
          
          <p>The research phase is the foundation of the the entire project. How could a designer create something without any idea as to what the project is for? The research phase includes, but is not limited to, a few different areas: a client interview, company and competition research and project overview. This creates a great foundation to know what the rest of the the competition is doing as well as certain characteristics of the company that should be reflected in the final design.</p>
          
          <h3 id="planning-and-concepts">Planning and Concepts</h3>
          
          <p>This process is where designers are the most creative. During this process, designers think through possible ideas, interactions and many other creative decisions. Designers, pencil and paper should still be a very important part of this process. This phase can break down into even more details such as: brainstorming, sketching and wireframing. In order to provide a great result, a concept must be solidified first which is why this process takes time.</p>
          
          <h3 id="digital-creation">Digital Creation</h3>
          
          <p>Clients and designers are usually the most happy during this stage. Clients are happy because they begin to see all the ideas come to fruition. Designers are happy because the concepts have been chosen and they begin to work on finalizing the shapes, sizes, colors, etc. This process can usually take the longest due to all the opinions involved.</p>
          
          <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
          
          <p>This process can vary depending on the details of the project and the final files that would need to be created or built-out in development. For example, a logo and business card would not take as long as a full website design and build-out. The amount of work that would need to be created can dramatically change the price. This is usually understood by both designer and client before the initial research stage.</p>
          
          <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
          
          <p>As everyone knows, pricing can be a sensitive subject. Because of this, each party should feel completely free to discuss these matters before emotions build up and the project is terminated before it begins. My final suggestions: designers, be sensitive to your client’s needs—your clients are work, which means money. Be careful to not push your clients away with strong opinions before the project even begins. Clients, trust the designer—they are trained to do exactly what you have hired them to do in the most
          efficient way possible.</p>
