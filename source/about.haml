            %p.mbs.tci
              Hi! My name is John. I am a multi‑disciplinary designer
              and developer based in Orlando currently working at
              <a href="http://madewithenvy.com/">Envy</a> and taking
              on select freelance projects. Between Envy and
              freelance, I help plan, design and build modern web
              applications and websites for large brands
              and small businesses.
            %p.mbf.tci
              As a daily routine, I enjoy spending time with my
              growing family and riding my bicycle to and from work
              and Envy. Because cycling is such a passion of mine,
              I enjoy taking on projects that directly&mdash;or
              indirectly &mdash;involve the great outdoors.

            %p.mbs
              My goal is to design applications and websites so
              that they are simple to use and to look at. To make
              sure that tings stay simple and easy to use, my
              process reflects that by being straightforward and
              not overly complicated.

              I like to make sure the simplicity of design is
              also transfered into the development phase by
              creating systems that are flexible and easily
              expandable. I use

        %h3 Scheduling
        %p
          I book my available time into one week increments. One
          week is equal to aproximately 10 hours of work, which
          is also the minimum amount of hours per project. Find
          my available weeks and book my time using the grid
          below. Simply select the date you would like your
          project to start.
        %h3 Rates
        %p
          All work is billed at <strong>$125 per hour</strong>
          with consulting&#8209;only services at a fixed price. If your
          project requires a fixed price, a non‑refundable down
          payment will be needed in order to reserve time.
          Otherwise, all time will need to be booked before
          project kickoff. There is minimum of 10 hours ($1250)
          per project.
        %h3 Legal
        %p
          All clients are be required to sign a Services
          Agreement. If an NDA is a requirement for the project,
          there will be an additional fee of $1250—the Services
          Agreement includes an NDA.
