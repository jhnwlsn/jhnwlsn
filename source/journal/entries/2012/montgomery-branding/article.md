During my schooling at [Full Sail University](http://online.fullsail.edu/), we were tasked to recreate our current state's capitol's branding. At the time, I was living in South Alabama which made my subject matter the city of Montgomery. Before the final designs were nailed down, I went through an extensive process of research, concepts after concepts, meticulous design and ended the entire project by creating some branding examples.

## Research
Several hours of research into the city's history and current trends led to finding that Montgomery is a business driven yet traditional southern town. The branding needed to represent both of these qualities evenly.

## Concepts
After research, I picked up a pencil and paper which helped me get my ideas out more quickly. These are a small sample of some concepts I came up with:

As you can see, some of these marks hit both the traditional southern and business driven qualities of Montgomery, but none  represented both qualities as well as the deer head.

## Mark Development
Then came the meticulous illustration of the deer head and design for supporting marks and typography. To be brief, the deer head and supporting marks symbolize the southern qualities of Montgomery while the typography represents the business industry in the city.

### Legal Seal
One of the most used element of a city's brand is its legal seal. Similarly to [guilloch√© patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilloche), excessive details help to keep the seal from being reproduced and/or manipulated without visual side effects.

## Representation
To finish off the project, I created a few examples of what the brand would look like by mocking up some stationery:
