I've always loved architecture&mdash;in fact, I wanted to be an architect when I was growing up. I was excited to work on this project (worth noting that this is a [Simple Focus](http://simplefocus.com/) project) for local Memphis architect Tim McCullough. He was starting a new adventure and need to make a "fresh start." As you may see, the mark not only symbolizes basic architecture geometric shapes but also includes his own first name in the mark.
